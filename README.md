# Integrating-a-WordPress-theme
Integration of a WordPress theme for a client in the business of real state. 

"Chalets and Caviar, an agency in Aspen, Colorado, has hired me to create their website. It has around 15 luxury chalets for sale and other chalets available to rent.They want a "clear, uncluttered, design that exudes luxury", the requirement is to offer them this result via a WordPress theme, customized so that the agency feels like their brand is well-represented. The agency has also requested a file explaining how to add, edit, and delete chalets from their listings."

This project includes :

A text file explaining which WordPress theme was chosen and why
URL of the WordPress site hosted online: http://aspenchaletsandcaviar.wordpress.com/
A CSS file of changes made to the theme
Wordpress PDF documentation of use to the agency
